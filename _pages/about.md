Based in the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, we are a basic science group aiming to transform cancer treatment. Our research interests cover a variaety of major problems in cancer biology and targeted therapies. We particularly study resistance to targeted therapies in cancer using a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. We are always looking to work with talented people with skills in computational biology, statistics, machine learning, systems biology and cell biology.

The Korkut Lab research is actively funded by NIH (NCI), MDA (Moonshots Program), ...
